- Co-taught UW Architecture Design studio. Was responsible for creating a Grasshopper script that takes in building geometry, allows the user to specific parametric components of design, and iterates through designs while performing simulations for various sustainability metrics.
- Co-led internal CODE group, advocating for the integration of computational design and building internal tools.
- Built a grasshopper script to iterate through building massing and simulate the impact of shading on neighboring building. The script cleans the simulation results for use in a Tableau dashboard. The dashboard was used as part of a legal case.
