- Collaborated with a small team of experienced developers to create a web application for a network of over 100 community refridgerators throughout NYC.
- Utilized Leaflet to create a map complete with a search bar that filters map map markers. The component can toggle between map and list views, and sorts fridge results by distance from the user.
- Created form for updating fridge status. The form takes advantage of the MUI stepper component and includes radio button and slider inputs. 
- Created photo upload component which handles type validation, conversion to Webp, and post request.
